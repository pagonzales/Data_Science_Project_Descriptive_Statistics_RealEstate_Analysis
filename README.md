# Real Estate Analysis (Using Descriptive Statistics and MS Excel)
## Project Objective
To look at the relationship between price V.S. area, and price V.S. age of a real estate property based on the data set from a certain real estate company using descriptive statistics and MS Excel. Also, to know which country is more likely to buy from the said real estate property

## Data used
- <a href = "https://github.com/pagonzales/Data_Science_Project_Descriptive_Statistics_RealEstate_Analysis/blob/main/Database.xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions
- How does the prices from the year 2004-2007 of a Real Estate company vary.
- What are the ages that is usually buying a real estate property?
- Is real estate expenditure related to age?
- Which country do most of the buyers come from?
- Is the real estate price related to the area?

## Process
- First, identify what type of data and level of measurements are in the data set.
- Next, create a frequency distribution graph of prices of real estate property using histogram
- From there, you can see the skewness of the graph and get some insights.
- Make a frequency graph also for the distribution of age of the buyer.
- Then, Create a scatter plot for both frequency distribution graph (price V.S. area, and price V.S. age)
- Next, calculate the corresponding covariance and correlation to further expand the analysis and their relationship.
- Make a frequency table in terms of country and calculate also the relative and cummulative frequency.
- Then, create a pareto diagram to gather what the contries contributing to the sold property.
- Finally, create a descriptive statistc using data analysis toolpack to confirm the data further.

## Project Insights
- In the year 2004-2007 data set from a given real estate company, we can see that,
  - the frequency distribution graph of price is positively skewed, meaning the most real estate prices are clustered at the lower end, but there are some very high-priced properties.
  - This means that there is a presence of a luxury property in the calculation. And most of the properties' prices are concentrated in the interval ($217,564.07 to 317,564.07)
  - Based on the data set, the ages from of the most buyers are in the bracket of 36-45 years old.
  - Using the data from the correlation and covariance of both price V.S. area, and price V.S. age, we can see that the price and area are correlated to each other, while the price and age have no significant correlation.
  - From the frequency table, we can see that 91% of the buyers come from the USA, followed by Canada and Russia. 
## Final Conclusion
- Using the graph and data, we conclude that price and area is related to each other, after all the larger the area, the higher should be the price. However, there is no significant correlation between age and price of a real estate property. Thus, real estate expenditure is NOT related to age.
